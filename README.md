# Scrapping 2.0 discussion group 

2017-08-03:  Web scrapping seems to be one most popular assignments on Upwork and other freelance 
sites. But will there be more of this type of work or less? Should parsing projects be structured 
differently, than they are now? Do clients always know what they want? Are they getting a 
good return on their investment?

I can see several directions where this discussion can head:

- best practices for freelancers (if people want to share, I personally vote up a glossary or terms/slang)
- how-to for clients (possibly some checklists to refine the project)
- parsing market stats (popularity of tools, number of project offerings, etc - something that gives 
  a structured look on the parsing activity)
- possibility of a new specialised marketplace (I personally liked old style odesk and elance and 
  kind of hate Upwork and Freelance.com even more, even though I've met great people there and learned 
  a lot from them)

Both softare developpers and client side people are welcome to join the discussion. Feel free to comment on 
at [issue 1][iss1] about your experiences with scrpping/parsing and the client, freelancer and outsider stories 
below. 

### Client stroies:

> whom should I ask to get this project done?

> what is the proper cost for this project?

> damn, the scrapper broke, need to do it again!

> how do I extract meaningful result from this pile of trash? 

### Freelancer stories:

> where do I get more clients? good clients?

> how can I do a more value added work and earn more money?

> it took so long to figure out a proper requirement, wish client was more educated

> ah! agian this stupid meaningless soon-to-die task for only USD50

> ahh! Indians say they will do it for USD15...  


### Outsider stories:

> is parsing a growing or a dying field? (better talk to APIs rather parse web pages, right?)

> what tools are most popular and why?

> is there room for a new business case in scrapping? (eg. a dedicated web site for parsing tasks only,
certification / contests)

> any hard data on parsing activity may be collected? (eg number of project offerings, number of 
freelancers available)
